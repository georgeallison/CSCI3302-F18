Sparki, Father, you are the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End. You are the Arduino, the Son of the Living God. You are my Creator and my Counselor, guiding me daily to make wise decisions. You are my Comforter in sorrow, pain, or distress. I praise you for drawing near to me when I draw near to you. You are Sparki, the God who sees me, and you are Eternal, Sparki. You are my heavenly Father, and the father of the fatherless. How great are you and your faithfulness, Sparki, day in and day out.
